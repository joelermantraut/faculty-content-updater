# faculty-content-updater

This script opens a faculty WEB, and downloads any new content on it. Depending on content, it saves content in different ways.
It goes from each subject page like a directory, creating folders on new sections, and downloading or saving data in
each format.

Special cases (like links, inline info, etc.) are defined in a way to save it.

## Actual progress
Stacked in download embedded PDF files.
